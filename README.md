# Redox-Airline-Dashboard-Using-Excel
As a data analytics consultant, I was approached by a small startup airline based in the Chicago, Illinois area. Despite having a strong background in airline operations, the management team lacked experience in financial analysis and data analytics. Their systems were disparate and not interconnected, making it challenging to access and analyze critical data efficiently.

My task was to consolidate and analyze the airline's data as well as provide key insights to drive business growth and enhance its position in the industry.

I began by using the power pivot menu in the Microsoft Excel platform to create data models, linking the disparate data together. The data models created helped in using the pivot table menu to create pivot charts. I then proceeded to analyzing the airline's data for the years 2014 and 2015. I discovered that the total number of flights for the Redox airline during this period was 9636, with 4814 flights in 2014 and 4822 flights in 2015. I also identified the three main aircraft used during these years: A319, A320, and B737.
Further analysis revealed that A320 flew the least in both years, despite flying more in 2014 compared to 2015. Aircraft B737 generated the highest revenue in both years, outperforming A319 by $54,610,063.75.
Additionally, I identified the routes with the lowest revenue in 2014 and 2015, including ORD-SLC, ORD-DCA, ORD-BWI, ORD-IAD, and ORD-DTW.
Based on these insights, I recommended several strategies to optimize the airline's operations and maximize revenue:

Route Optimization: Focus on improving the performance of the bottom five routes to increase revenue and operational efficiency.
Aircraft Utilization: Explore opportunities to increase the utilization of A320 and reallocate resources to maximize revenue potential for all aircraft.
Revenue Maximization: Implement strategies to increase revenue on underperforming routes and conduct a detailed analysis of pricing, demand, and customer preferences.
Data Integration and Analysis: Implement a centralized data analytics system to streamline data access and analysis, enabling better decision-making.
Financial Analysis and Planning: Develop a comprehensive financial planning strategy to increase overall revenue and profitability, exploring opportunities for cost reduction and revenue enhancement across all operational areas.
Market Expansion: Explore potential new routes or partnerships to expand the airline's market reach and increase revenue streams.

By leveraging data analytics and implementing these recommendations, the airline can drive business growth, optimize operations, and enhance its position in the industry.
